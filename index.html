        <h2>The Prelude</h2>
        <div class="prelude-content">
            <p>Many many years ago, the quondam northern Carrold empire(Carrold empire) was the largest and mightiest kingdom in this land which was blessed by the constellation goddess. The constellation goddess bestowed twelve gems of constellation upon the king of the northern Carrold empire and told him: may these magical treasures bring happiness and wisdom to your people. However, despite the kindness and generosity of this great monarch, there would always be those who coveted the power and treasure of this land, and thus the deity of greed generated. Not long after that, the deity of greed enticed the demons and hogs into invading the northern Carrold empire in order to grab the gems of constellation, and the whole land was in tremendous danger.</p>
            <p>When there were calamities, there also were heroes. After fighting for plentiful centuries, the riot was quelled with the deity of greed finally sealed, and the realm obtained the peace again, except for the loss of the precious gems of constellation. The constellation goddess was extremely disappointed and sorrowful, so she ordered a new hero to reclaim the gems of constellation. Nevertheless, the hero found that many gems had been collected by different sovereigns, and coincidentally, the pope was searching for those gems as well. Consequently the power of the hero was definitely limited, plus, the current monarch of the northern Carrold empire was a truly crude tyrant, which meant that it was almost impossible to obtain the assistance of the king. Considering the situation the goddess finally resolved to take some extreme methods, and soon, the old tyrant died of unknown and a completely new and goddess-selected monarch was born.</p>
